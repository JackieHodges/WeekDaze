### Description

Our application is designed to give the user the experience of organizing, managing, and updating their job search.

### Installation

Simply click the Heroku link, and go to the resulting page in your web browser to use the application.

### Usage

To begin, sign up for an account using your name, email, and creating a password. Once you're signed in, you'll see an empty chart and job input field. Start by clicking on the "Add Job" button, and log the name of the company you've applied for, your desired position, and the current stage of hiring that you're in. Press the "Save" button to keep your new data, and see the job show on the chart above that describes how many days its been since you've applied fpr that specific job. To make notes, click on the desired role, where you are taken to the Milestone page. Here, you can update and make notes about each individual application you've created.
